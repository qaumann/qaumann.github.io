Welcome, my name is Quirin. Until 2022 I was a postdoctoral researcher at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems</a> focusing on model order reduction and surrogate modeling techniques for complex dynamical systems.

I studied civil engineering (B.Sc.) and computational mechanics (M.Sc.) at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tum.de">Technical University of Munich (TUM)</a> from 2010 until 2017.
Following, I worked as a research assistant at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cee.ed.tum.de/en/bm">Chair of Structural Mechanics</a> at TUM and I received my PhD in 2022.
Since 2021 I have been a member of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/research/groups/csc">Computational Methods in Systems and Control Theory</a> group at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems.

My main research interests are robust and efficient model order reduction strategies and I am decicated to making these methods applicable to a wide range of different problem classes.
In particular, I am interested in methods preserving important characteristics of the original dynamical system.
I am also working on data-driven methods and am investigating strategies how to implement them in existing engineering design worfklows.
I believe in open data and publish the software and datasets for my scientific work whenever possible.
