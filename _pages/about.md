Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/) focusing on model order reduction and surrogate modeling techniques for complex dynamical systems.

I studied civil engineering (B.Sc.) and computational mechanics (M.Sc.) at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de) from 2010 until 2017.
Following, I was working as a research assistant at the [Chair of Structural Mechanics](https://www.cee.ed.tum.de/en/bm) at TUM and I received my PhD in 2022.
Since 2021 I have been a member of the [Computational Methods in Systems and Control Theory](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/research/groups/csc) group at Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems.

My main research interests are robust and efficient model order reduction strategies and I thrive to make these methods applicable to a wide range of different problem classes.
In particular, I am interested in methods preserving the structure of the original dynamical system.
I am also working on data-driven methods and am investigating strategies how to implement them in existing engineering design worfklows.
I believe in open data and publish the software and datasets for my scientific work whenever possible.
