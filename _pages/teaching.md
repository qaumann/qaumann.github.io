During my time as a research assistant at TUM I was a lecturer for groups of up to 250 students. I was responsible for curriculum development, course administration, and grading. In total I taught four undergraduate and two graduate courses.

More specifically I was involved in the conceptualization, organization, and realization of the course <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cee.ed.tum.de/bm/lehre/masterstudiengaenge/modelling-and-simulation/">Modelling and Simulation in Structural Mechanics</a>, a course on advanced modeling and simulation methods in structural dynamics which is offered to Master’s students. These efforts were awarded with the TUM fund _Study-related initiatives to strengthen the excellence strategy 2019_ (€ 58,369).

Up to now I supervised 15 semester projects, 9 Bachelor's theses, and 6 Master's theses.

<!-- Since 2021 I am the PhD mentor of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cee.ed.tum.de/bm/mitarbeiterinnen/sebastian-schopper/">Sebastian Schopper</a>. -->
